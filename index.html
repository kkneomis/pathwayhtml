				<h1>Cybersecurity Defined</h1>
				</div>
		       <p >The definition of cybersecurity as an industry is still evolving and emerging. Many industry and military partners define the industry as those tasks that comprise information assurance and information security activities.</p>
              
              <p>The National Security Agency (NSA) defines cybersecurity using the following terms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong> Information Assurance (IA)</strong> <br>
Information Assurance comprises measures that protect and defend information and information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation. These measures include providing for restoration of information systems by incorporating protection, detection, and reaction capabilities.</li>

                <li><strong> Information Systems Security (Information Security, ISS, INFOSEC)</strong> <br>
Protection of information systems against unauthorized access to, or modification of, information, whether in storage, processing, or transit, and against the denial of service to authorized users, including those measures necessary to detect, document, and counter such threats.</li>
      </ul>
            <p> The U.S. Department of Labor identified cybersecurity specialists as "the workers who protect the data and systems in networks that are connected to the Internet. But it is no easy task to deﬁne who, exactly, these specialists are. In part because of that difficulty, their training requirements vary widely. One thing seems certain, however: Cybersecurity is a growing career ﬁeld."<p>

				<h1>Cybersecurity in Maryland</h1>
				</div>
            
          <p style="text-align:left">Maryland has a critical mass of federal agencies and information technology companies that place it as a national epicenter of federal cybersecurity activities. World-class cybersecurity facilities include NSA, Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, 12 major military installations (including Fort Meade in Anne Arundel County which is home to the Navy Fleet Cyber Command and the new U.S. Cyber Command), and hundreds of federal contractors and private technology companies. Maryland information technology employment is dominated by firms that provide computer systems design, key players in cybersecurity activities. Overwhelmingly, stakeholders in Maryland report a need to increase the pipeline of qualified cyber workers as the state’s most immediate and significant challenge.</p>

        <p ><strong> The field of cybersecurity is projected to grow by 41% in the next 8 years. Still an emerging field, the median hourly earning is $38 an hour.</strong> </p>
          
          
        <h3>Business Cybersecurity Measures</h3>
       
        <p>Not only are cybersecurity measures important for defense and governmental entities, they are important for any industry or business needing to secure confidential information from hacking. Types of businesses can include banks, health care providers, major corporations, information technology, e-retailers and businesses, or any small business connected via the internet.
