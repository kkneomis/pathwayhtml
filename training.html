						  <h1>TRAINING</h1>
  <p style="text-align:left">Cybersecurity training is offered at three area community colleges: Anne Arundel, Howard, and Carroll Community Colleges. Training has been organized into 10 suggested tracks. The tracks are arranged to ensure that students have the prior prerequisites in order to be successful in their chosen track. In addition, the structured tracks assist students by providing recommended course sequencing.<br><br>

Individuals can be confident that, after completion of their selected track, they will have gained the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to secure a job in their chosen area of study. Additionally, students are prepared to sit for numerous industry certifications exams, many of which are addressed in DOD directive 8570.1.<br><br>

Individuals with little computer experience are advised to begin their studies by selecting an introductory track – Tracks 1, 2, or 3. Those students with a solid computer foundation are welcome to begin in an introductory or advanced track. It is important to note the stackable nature of the tracks. This allows individuals to expand their knowledge by being able to transition from their initial track into a more advanced track, or into a new area of interest.</p>
